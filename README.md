# Usage  
***The dataset is too big to up load. So firstly you have to make your own dataset.***  
**Generate your video dataset:**  
 Make some videos with your camera. Run **video_manully_add_label.py** to generate pickle dataset.  
**Train:**  
 Run **train_networks.py** to train the model.  
 some pretrained models are used like Resnet50,VGG16 and so on. You can choose one you like to extract features.
